![amiresposive-heroku](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78651133/178527987-096bc711-4a41-4b6a-8833-ec15ac4e4a9a.jpg)

The Los Santos Reservation Application is a console-based application which allows the user to fill out a form to formalise a reservation for a ficticious hotel, the information of which is sent to and updated on a spreadsheet row. The user interface for this project is entirely text-based and is run on a text terminal.

The application begins with a main menu, giving the user the option to find out information for room types and contact information for the establishment. The user is then able to proceed and officialise a reservation by filling out key information, those being their name, age, number of guests, e-mail address, room type, check-in date and check-out date. Based on this information, a total price is calculated, and the reservation information is displayed to the user and is then sent to a Google Sheets form where it appended onto a corresponding row. 

This project is the third in a series of five that must be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/full-stack-software-development-diploma/?utm_term=code%20institute&utm_campaign=CI+-+ROW+-+Search+-+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_cam=15207113220&hsa_grp=130324141420&hsa_ad=581817633110&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=aud-1602480256028:kwd-319867646331&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjwt7SWBhAnEiwAx8ZLaiysHOvTv_fv50_dJV1M0VQ97gpB6x147RSwbBFnIgYEorNXsoXm9RoCMq8QAvD_BwE).

## **Requirements**

To create a Python based application using libraries/API that takes user input data, parses the information and validates it, handles potential user errors and exports said data into an appropriate dataset file. 

Such data information should be able to provide actionable insights, in this case, reservation information by the user.
